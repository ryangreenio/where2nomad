For many people, working from home is a dream come true. It's a chance to get some extra time for themselves and their families, and there are plenty of benefits to be had.

Since the pandemic started, remote work trends and expectations have changed. Working from home is no longer seen as a reward or perk, it's now an expectation for most employees.

Over a third of working adults ([36%](https://www.ons.gov.uk/employmentandlabourmarket/peopleinwork/employmentandemployeetypes/articles/homeworkingandspendingduringthecoronaviruscovid19pandemicgreatbritain/april2020tojanuary2022)) reported having worked from home at least once between 19 and 30 January 2022 during the pandemic. As a result, employers from around the world are adapting to flexible schedules for their remote teams which has led to new remote work trends and more remote work options than ever before.

But like anything else, there are drawbacks too - this article explores both the benefits and drawbacks of work from home to help you decide if remote work is right for you.

## Remote work: What is it?

Remote work is any type of work that can be done from a distance. This includes work from home, telecommuting, and freelance work.

Many people choose to do remote work because it allows them to balance their work and personal lives more easily. It also gives people the opportunity to travel and explore new places while they continue to earn an income.

There are many different types of remote jobs, and the best way to find one is to do a Google search for 'remote jobs'.

## Types of remote jobs

While the term 'remote work' can encompass a broad range of job types, it generally refers to positions that can be done from anywhere in the world, as long as you have an internet connection.

This includes jobs like remote customer service reps, graphic designers, programmers, online teachers, and freelance writers.

The great thing about remote work is that it opens up opportunities for people who may not be able to work traditional office jobs. For example, someone with a disability or someone who lives in a rural area without many job opportunities; working remotely allows them to find a great remote job that fits their needs.

### Remote work models

The hybrid working model combines traditional office work with remote work. This model allows employees to balance the benefits of working from home with the benefits of working in an office.

Typically an employee will be in the office 2-3 days per week and spend the rest of the week remotely.

Another model is the distributed team model, which is ideal for companies that have employees located in different parts of the world. This model allows employees to work from home or in a local office, depending on their location.

The final remote work model is the telecommuting model, which is ideal for companies that have employees who are unable to travel to an office. This model allows employees to work from home full-time or part-time.

## Work From Home Pros

There are many benefits to working from home, remote work, or being a nomad. Some of these benefits include:

### 1. Increased productivity

When you're not stuck in traffic, or wasting time getting ready for work, you can get right to work. This increased productivity can lead to getting more done in less time.

### 2. Less stress

Not having to worry about the daily commute, or dealing with office politics, can lead to a less stressful life.

### 3. Flexible hours

Being able to set your own hours can be a huge benefit. You can work when you're most productive, and take time off when you need it.

### 4. More family time

With flexible hours, you can spend more time with your family. This is especially beneficial for parents who need to be home when their kids get off from school.

### 5. Less money spent on transportation

If you're no longer commuting to work, you will not have to spend as much on gas and parking.

### 6. More time for hobbies

Being able to work from home can allow you more time for hobbies, like gardening or running.

### 7. Work from anywhere in the world

Depending on the type of remote work you do, there are many options to work abroad providing you can find accommodation and a good internet connection.

### 8. Improved well-being &amp; lifestyle

Mental health, well-being and lifestyle are important aspects of work to avoid burn-out. With remote work being less intense and a bit more peaceful - one survey conducted by [RSPH](https://www.rsph.org.uk/about-us/news/survey-reveals-the-mental-and-physical-health-impacts-of-home-working-during-covid-19.html)revealed that people working from home felt it was better for their health and wellbeing (45%).

### 9. Creature comforts

Being in your own home and having a space you feel comfortable in can lead to increased productivity. Whether it's having your bed nearby for an afternoon nap or not worrying about what outfit you're wearing, comfort is an advantageous aspect of working from home.

### 10. Freedom

Ultimately, working from home provides employees with freedom and flexibility. You can set your own hours and take care of your personal needs at the same time.

## The cons of working from home

There are many pros to working from home, but there are also some cons. Here are some of the main disadvantages of working from home:

### 1. You can easily get distracted

When you're in your own environment, it's easy to get sidetracked by things like the dishes that need to be washed or the laundry that needs to be done.

### 2. You can lose touch with your colleagues

When you work from home, you can easily lose touch with what's going on at the office and with your co-workers. This can make it difficult to collaborate on projects or catch up on news.

### 3. It can be hard to stay motivated

When you're not in an office environment, it can be hard to stay motivated and focused on your work. Distractions can easily occur, so it's important to create a work environment that supports productivity.

### 4. You might miss out on company culture

When you work remotely, you can't just pop into the office for a meeting or to grab a cup of coffee. You're missing out on all of the informal conversations and interactions that take place in the office. This can make it difficult to build relationships with your colleagues and to feel like part of a team.

### 5. Difficult to separate work and personal time

Work-life balance is a challenge for many people, but it can be especially difficult to separate work and personal time when you work from home or remotely. It can be hard to know when to switch off when your office and living room are the same place!

### 6. You might miss out on employee benefits

According to a study by the Society for Human Resource Management, only 43% of employers offer telecommuting as an option. That means employees who work from home might not be eligible for some benefits, like health insurance or 401k matching contributions. You can also forget the free doughnuts.

7. It can be hard to find a place to work

There are some people who prefer working from home because they don't like being surrounded by other people or they don't like the noise and distraction that comes with an office environment.

### 8. Less opportunities for a promotion

A study by Stanford University found that people who work from home are less likely to get promoted than those who work in an office. This may be due to the fact that working from home can limit your exposure to potential mentors and networking opportunities.

Another study by the University of Illinois found that remote workers are less likely to get raises or promotions than those who work in an office. This may be due to the fact that remote workers often have fewer opportunities to build relationships with their supervisors and colleagues.

### 9. Isolation

Working from home can be isolating. You may not have the opportunity to socialize with co-workers, and you may miss out on important office meetings.

You may find yourself working long hours because there's no clear line between work and personal time.

### 10. Limited job opportunities

When searching for job opportunities, there are certain roles which cannot be done remotely. This may limit your search and prevent you from applying to roles that might be office based.

## Finding a remote job

If you've weighed up the pros and cons and are still considering pursuing the work from home lifestyle you've dreamed about there are a few things you can do to increase your chances of finding one that's a good fit for you.

The best way to start is by looking at job boards that specialize in remote jobs, like We Work Remotely or Remote OK. You can also search for jobs on LinkedIn or Indeed. You can also check out job postings on company websites. A lot of companies are now hiring remotely, so you might have better luck this way.

Social media can be a great way to find remote jobs too. Follow companies and individuals who work remotely and see if they're hiring. Finally, don't forget to network! Talk to your friends and family members about any remote opportunities they may have heard about.

If you're tired of commuting or feeling chained to your work schedule, you may want to consider working from home. With the right tools and a bit of creativity, you can create a work environment that's comfortable and efficient for you.
